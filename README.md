This is a smart car parking system implemented using Arduino. It uses IR sensors connected to digital pins (D1, D2) to detect when a car enters or requests a parking space. The system tracks the number of cars parked and calculates available parking slots in real time.

💡 Features
1.Detects vehicle entry via IR sensor on pin D1
2.Displays available space on trigger via IR sensor on pin D2
3.Maximum parking capacity: 50 cars
4.Automatically alerts when parking is full
5.Resets counter if an overflow occurs

⚙️ Hardware Requirements
1.Arduino ESP8266 or compatible board
2.2x IR sensors (for entry and space check)
3.Jumper wires
4.Breadboard
5.USB cable
6.Computer with Arduino IDE
